# Amazon-Product-Recommendation-System

It is very important for any ecommerce business to hold on to their customers and keep their interest levels up, to ensure engagement and profits of business. One way to do this is to know your customers in and out, their buying patterns, history, interest in categories, understand how they browse and how they buy products when prompted with similar items. As a business, to keep users engaged we want to show them feed/products that might interest them and they’ll likely end up buying. 
Such a personalization is possible on multiple levels by looking at :
1.	Suggesting relevant content/ products by a hybrid of content and collaborative filtering based on item and users. Similar products may be recommended influenced by features such as functionality, price, delivery date, ratings etc.
2.	Suggesting products bought by users similar to you.
3.	Suggesting personalized bundles of products. (example : buy these three products together and get a discount of $10)
4.	Suggesting similar items by finding similar items based on item features
We used the amazon review datasets to solve some of the above problems of personalizing user experience. 

### Algorithms used are :
1.	Content based filtering
2.	Collaborative filtering using SVD
3.	Collaborative filtering using ALS – Apache Spark
4.	Bipartite graphs
Technology and Tools used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, HPC, Apache Spark
